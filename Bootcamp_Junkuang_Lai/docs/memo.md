Assumptions: Historical pricing data is accurate and reliable for analysis purposes.
Constraints:
Time limitation: The project must be completed within the 2-week bootcamp timeframe, restricting analysis to historical data rather than live market testing, as a 2-week period would provide insufficient sample size for meaningful live testing.
Data accessibility: The project is limited by the stock price information available through the Yahoo finance (yfinance) APIs, which may not include all desired data points or market coverage.
Alternative version with more formal language:
Assumptions: Historical pricing data provides accurate and reliable information for analytical purposes.
Constraints:
Project timeline: Completion is required by the end of the 2-week bootcamp, necessitating reliance on historical data analysis rather than live market testing, as the limited timeframe would yield inadequate sample sizes for live testing validation.
Data availability: Analysis scope is constrained by the stock price information accessible through Yahoo finance (yfinance) APIs, which may have limitations in data coverage and availability.
