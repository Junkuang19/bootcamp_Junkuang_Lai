### bullet points

- Package model artifact and metadata (model.pkl, features.json, training_date, preprocessing notes) into the model/ folder and push to repo or artifact store.
- Provide an inference wrapper (src/model_infer.py) that exposes load_model(), preprocess(), predict(), postprocess(), plus unit tests and saved test vectors.
- CI/CD: pipeline job to run unit tests, build docker image, and deploy to staging; include a smoke test (endpoint /health and simple predict).
- Monitoring: provision dashboards (Grafana/Cloud) for the listed Data/Model/System/Business metrics and tie alerts to PagerDuty/Teams.
- Runbook links: include quick-run commands, rollback steps, and contact on-call (add URL placeholders in repo README).
- Ownership table: list Data Owner, ML Owner, SRE, Product Owner with email/Slack and primary responsibilities.
- Post-deploy plan: 4-week elevated monitoring (daily checks), weekly performance review, and retrain criteria + scheduled retrain cadence.
- Security & compliance: list required env vars and secrets handling (vault/GCP secret manager) and
